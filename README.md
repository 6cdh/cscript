# A toy for inlining C in Python

A toy inspired by the concept of dynamic link library introduced in CSAPP 3e chapter 7.

## Usage

See [cscript_test.py](cscript_test.py) for usage.

## Clone

```shell
git clone https://github.com/6cdh/inline_C_in_Python.git
```

## Test

```shell
pytest
```

## Known Issues

In fact, running pytest may raise Segmentation fault. However, csript_test.py works individually. I have no idea.

Feel free to correct my English, code and others. Thanks!
